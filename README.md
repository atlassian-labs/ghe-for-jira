# GitHub Enterprise for Jira Integration

This app can be installed into a Jira site to integrate GitHub Enterprise (Server) into Jira. It' built on top of Atlassian's [Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) platform. 

**Warning!** This app is still very much in an alpha state and will need some polishing to be ready to use in production environments.
